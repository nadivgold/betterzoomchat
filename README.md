# Better Zoom Chat
![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadivgold/betterzoomchat/main/bzc.png)

BZC is a chrome extention that allows you to use some Twitch Emotes inside Zoom Meeting Group Chats. 

Download the files and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/). 
Enable developer mode and select 'Load Unpacked', then open the folder.

Use the 'Launch Meeting' button in the extention rather than the normal blue one to take you to Zoom's web client.
If the emotes don't show up instantly, open the extension panel. 

Since I added emotes individually, not all of them are avaliable. The objects in `content.js` list all the currently supported emotes. Feel free to make a PR to add your favorites.
