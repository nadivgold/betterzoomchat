## How to Use
1. This extension only works with the Zoom's web client. To make it easier to launch the web client, I recommend using the extension's 'Launch Meeting' button rather than the blue one that prompts to open the downloaded client.
2. If emotes don't show up, open and close the extension panel.  
3. Since I added emotes individually, not all of them are available. The objects in `content.js` list all the currently supported emotes.


**Feel free to make a PR to add your favorite emotes.**
